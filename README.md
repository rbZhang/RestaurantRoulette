## RestaurantRoulette

Restaurant Roulette is a web application that sugguests users a random restaurant. 
It uses the user's current location and their input of the type of meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) to find a restaurant 
within their proximity. 

The application was developed to combat indecisiveness among my friends when deciding on which restaurant to dine at.

## Technology and knowledge

The application was developed using ASP.Net MVC and [Zomato's API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) to search for restaurants.
In developing this application, I practiced HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# and learnt how to deserialize JSON data in MVC.
